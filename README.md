* What Types of Software Require Engineering?

A systematic and disciplined approach isn’t necessary for every endeavor. You don’t need engineering training to design a simple game or a program that teaches your child to read. You do need it, though, to create high stakes software for the defense department.

Businesses also employ software engineers to create customized software and address vulnerabilities before they happen. This makes sense when we think of the complexity of the tasks that the average professional carries out, tasks like holding meetings in real time with collaborators oceans away. Even when engineering principles aren’t necessary for safety, sound design can increase efficiency and decrease costs.

You’ll find a diverse group of employers advertising for true software engineers. Disney Interactive Media is among the companies seeking software developers who are familiar with the software development life cycle.

* Education and Job Prospects for Software Engineers

There are two main branches of software engineering. Applications software engineers create and maintain computer applications. Systems software engineers analyze technical needs department by department and create or maintain appropriate systems. Setting up and maintaining intranet systems would fall under their scope.

Software engineers typically hold at least a baccalaureate degree. A master’s is necessary for some positions. The focus is on acquiring a core of software development knowledge that will remain relatively stable across a span of years, even as new languages are developed and others go out of favor.

Software engineering is a growing field, even during difficult economic times. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that while employers may outsource some positions, outsourcing is less likely to occur in highly specialized computer and software engineering positions than in lower level programming positions. There are exciting opportunities for those with an educational background in software engineering, computer science, software development, computer engineering and similar disciplines.

* Why interesting
It explains why software development is an engineering process and what kinds of development need engineering and what do not. It also make us more clear about what are the branches of software engineering and what prospectives do we have upon entering the work force. It is truly an indispensable field that is highly demanded in the years ahead.
